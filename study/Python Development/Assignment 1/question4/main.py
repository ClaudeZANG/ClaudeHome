# Question 4: A Personal Fitness tracker is a wearable device that tracks oneâ€™s physical activity, calories burned,
# heart rate, sleeping patterns and so on. One common physical activity that is tracked is the number of steps that you
# take each day. The File named Steps.txt contains the number of steps that a user has made each day for an entire year
# (Jan 1 to Dec 31) Write a program that reads the file, then displays the average number of steps taken for each month.
# Assume the data is from a year that is not a leap year, therefore, February has 28 days. The program should then
# count the number of days in the year that the user has made 10,000 steps or more and display the number of days
# with 10000 or more steps. (10 marks)
